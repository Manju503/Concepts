# Learning Process

## Question 1:
What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is a learning approach where you deepen your understanding by explaining concepts to others and correcting any gaps.

## Question 2:
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea in the video for me is transitioning between the diffuse mode and focus mode, using ideas generated in the diffuse mode to solve problems. The diffuse mode is when you're relaxed, and your brain works in the background, coming up with new ideas or seeing how things fit together. The focus mode, on the other hand, is when you're fully concentrating on a task, thinking deeply about it step by step. Even when we're not actively working, our minds process ideas in the background. Examples like Thomas Edison and Salvador Dal√≠ illustrate how they leveraged this approach to creatively solve problems by applying diffuse-mode insights in focus mode.

## Question 3:

What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active and diffused modes are two ways your brain works to learn and solve problems:  

- Active Mode: When you're fully focused on a task, thinking deeply about it step by step.  
- Diffused Mode: When you're relaxed, and your brain works in the background, coming up with new ideas or seeing how things fit together.

## Question 4:
According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

These are the steps to quickly learn a new skill:  

- Deconstruct the Skill: Break the skill into smaller, manageable parts.  
- Learn Enough to Self-Correct: Understand the basics to recognize and fix mistakes as you practice.  
- Focus on Important Subskills: Concentrate on the key parts that will give the biggest impact.  
- Set a Practice Target: Dedicate at least 20 hours to focused practice.  
- Remove Barriers to Practice: Eliminate distractions or obstacles that may prevent consistent practice.  

## Question 5:

What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- Apply the Feynman Technique to simplify and clarify concepts by explaining them.  
- Stay fully engaged in tasks while minimizing distractions.  
- Switch between focused and relaxed thinking modes to solve problems effectively.  
- Break the concepts into smaller parts and prioritize key tasks for faster progress.  
- Use productivity tools like Boosted or Freedom to manage time and block interruptions.  
- Treat deadlines as guides for time management rather than sources of stress.  
- Cultivate curiosity and make learning enjoyable.  
- Own the knowledge by simplifying concepts and applying them to real projects.  
- Focus on deep work sessions and turn off unnecessary notifications.  
- Communicate challenges early and seek help when needed.
