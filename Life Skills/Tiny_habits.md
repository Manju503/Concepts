### Question1:

- Rewarding ourselves after completing the small tiny habits.

### Question3:

- Celebrating successes, no matter how small, acts as a reward and boosts self-motivation. This positive reinforcement increases the likelihood of continuing the habit, making it easier to sustain long-term progress.

- Whereas in the 2012 olympics british cyclists had been secured nearly 70% of the total medals.

### Question5:
### What is the book's perspective about Identity?

- The book emphasizes that long-term transformation stems from identity change. Your current behaviors reflect your current identity. To change your behavior, you need to start adopting beliefs that align with the person you want to become.

### Question6:
### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

- Making a habit easier involves reducing friction, designing an environment for success, and keeping habits small and enjoyable. Removing barriers to starting a habit makes it more automatic and sustainable. Over time, these small changes compound into meaningful, lasting transformations.
  
### Question7:
### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

- To make a habit harder to do, you can increase friction, remove triggers, use commitment devices, or create obstacles. By designing your environment to make bad habits less accessible and mentally reframing their appeal, you reduce the chances of engaging in them.

### Question8:
### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?


I am committed to establishing a daily walking habit

- Initially, I will start with walking 0.5 km each day and gradually increase the distance by 10% every day to challenge myself.
- To stay motivated, I will reward myself with fresh fruits after completing my daily walking milestone.
- This will help me build consistency and celebrate my progress along the way.

### Question9:
### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
